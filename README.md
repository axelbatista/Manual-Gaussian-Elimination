I initally made this at first to help me with automating matrix operations for my Linear Algebra class. This was good and got the job done, but I do consider this obselete
now that I made the calculator version of this which just does the operations for you. This avoids a lot of the tedium that comes with having to type out and memorize 
operations and rows/columns. I'm including this here because it does work and it shows my transition.
